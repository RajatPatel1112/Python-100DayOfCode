#creating nested if_elif_else
"""
Day7 Challenge
Create a program that asks what someone is interested in and includes
nested if statements to ask annoying follow-up questions to see if 
someone is the real deal!
Make sure you include multiple if/elif statements and nested if statements too!

Let ouput be like:
What's your favourite anime? {input}

Oh really?! Name me any of the character? {input}

You got that by pure chance. Okay then, what is his job on the ship?{input}

hmph! What was his first bounty then? {input}

Nice, You are a true fan of one piece
